        <p class="content">I am a financial business analyst turned aspiring UX designer. After working for a few years as a business analyst, my favorite part of my job was working with a variety of internal departments and working through different solutions to everyday problems, but I felt a gap on how new process would impact the employees that will use the new process on a day-to-day basis. I decided to make a pivot to UX design so that I could create better experience for the day-to-day users. </p>
